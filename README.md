*Foundations of Software Engineering Group Project Assignment*

## Prerequisites

* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Clone the project
* Navigate to the project root directory and run '<npm install>' to install the server dependencies
* Navigate to the client directory ('<cd client>') and run <npm install>' to install the client dependencies

## Running the project

1. Sart the Server: In the project root directory, run '<node server/index.js>'
You should see a message indicating that the server is running, e.g., "Server running on port 4000".

2. Start the Client: Open a new terminal, navigate to the client directory, and run '<npm start'>. This will open the game in your default web browser.
